# Dog-Breed Classifier

## Project Overview
This project is a part of Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree. The goal of this project is to build an CNN models for classification by using Pytorch python library. The algorithm identifies an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.


## Code
The code is provided in the Image `dog_app.ipynb` file. The project also includes `test_images` folder that contains images for testing.


## Data
